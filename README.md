# kali-standalone-instruction
This instruction was inspired by official document titled [Standalone Kali Linux 2021.4 Installation on a USB Drive, Fully Encrypted](https://www.kali.org/docs/usb/usb-standalone-encrypted/), and further modified or tested each time I reinstalled my kali system. The script install.sh is not a real executable shell script, but rather a record of what the READER should have done while 
- preparing target usb drive and table files;
- performing the actual installation;
- setting up inital ram and removable grub.

And this project will be maintained all the time until I give up Kali Linux some day, when is supposed to be non-existence!
